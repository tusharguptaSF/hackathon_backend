## About the System

As the entire word is passing through the COVID-19 pandemic, all scientists across the word
are working on inventing the vaccine for this. Few of them were passed in initial trials and also
got permission from the government.
Government needs to initiate the vaccination program with below plan:

1. Initially the vaccine will be given to Frontline health workers, Soldiers and all citizens
with age above 50 years.
2. Everyone has to register as per the above eligibility.
3. They want to maintain a separate list for each Category like soldier, senior citizen etc.
4. Vaccine will be given on a first-come(registration) first-serve basis.
5. Once the vaccine is given then the person's name should be removed from the
respective list.
6. At the same time, the government also wants to track all the vaccinated peoples. So,
their data needs to be maintained in some other collection.
7. This data should be sorted on the basis of vaccination date and also accessible using a
unique id.
